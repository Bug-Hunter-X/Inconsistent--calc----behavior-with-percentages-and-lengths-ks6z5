The CSS `calc()` function can produce unexpected results if you use it with percentages and lengths in a way that isn't fully supported by all browsers.  For example, the following code might not work as expected in all browsers:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

This is because the subtraction of pixels from a percentage is not consistently interpreted.  Some browsers might calculate 50% of the container's width first, then subtract 10px, while others might attempt a different calculation order, potentially leading to layout issues.
